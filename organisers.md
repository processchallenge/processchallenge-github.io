        	<a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=5ccB6BcAAAAJ&hl=en">Heidi Christensen</a> is a Professor in School of Computer Science at the University of Sheffield and the head of the school. I am part of the Speech and Hearing Research Group (SPandH) and a theme lead for the UKRI Centre for Doctoral Training in speech and language technologies and their applications. She am the technical lead for CognoSpeak™, a speech-based tool for detecting and tracking early signs of cognitive impairment. She has a long-standing interest in improving equality and diversity and I take an active interest in the EDI work within our university. Wider, I am on the diversity committee of ISCA (International Speech Communication Association) and the Diversity and Inclusion chair for Interspeech 2023. Her research interests are in the application of audio and speech technology to the healthcare domain and include three main areas: the automatic recognition of disordered, atypical speech, the detection and tracking of verbal and non-verbal traits in speech and language, Equality, diversity and inclusion issues in speech technology research and applications.

        	Dr <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=ncnEETQAAAAJ&hl=en">Simon Bell</a> is a NIHR Clinical Lecturer in Neurology, university of Sheffield, focusing on developing the understanding of dysfunctional metabolism in dementia and how this may be developed into future treatments and biomarkers for the disease. His interest in Neurosciences and Alzheimer’s disease started whilst performing my undergraduate medical studies at Bristol University. Here He intercalated in Neuroscience under the supervision of Dr Shelly Allen-Burt, Dr David Dawbarn, and Professor Seth Love. For his BSc he characterised the Bondi Body, a pathological aggregate found within the Choroid Plexus, which is seen in increased numbers in Alzheimer’s disease. After qualifying in Medicine he did junior doctor jobs in Gloucester, Bristol, Leeds and Brisbane Australia. He gained clinical experience in Neurology, Neurosurgery and Stroke Medicine and research experience at the University of Leeds where He performed a post-graduate diploma in Health Research.  On completion of his junior doctor jobs and after passing his Membership of the Royal College of Physicians (MRCP), He took up a Neurology Speciality Training post in Sheffield and continued my research into Alzheimer’s disease, with an Alzheimer Research UK (ARUK) preparatory Clinical Fellowship, and NIHR Academic Clinical Fellowship. His Wellcome 4ward North PhD Fellowship analysed the metabolism of astrocytes and other cell types in Alzheimer’s disease using an induced Neuronal Progenitor Cell model system (supervisors Dr Heather Mortiboys, Dr Laura Ferraiuolo, Dr Daniel Blackburn and Professor Stephen Wharton).

        	Dr <a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=WbGA3voAAAAJ&hl=en">Daniel Blackburn</a> is a Senior lecturer and honorary consultant neurologist at Sheffield Institute for Translational Neuroscience. His research interests are into non-invasive diagnostic tests for early dementia or cognitive impairment using electroencephalography (EEG) and conversation analysis. He has helped co-create a tool (CognoSpeakTM) that asks questions using a ‘talking head’ on a laptop, tablet or smartphone and carefully analyses the answers to detect a decline in cognitive health including very early signs of dementia in speech patterns. Language impairments occur early in Alzheimer’s disease but can be easily missed by non-expert clinicians. Daniel is interested in the features that can be detected during normal interaction. He worked on a study investigating this with linguist assessments of audio and video recordings from memory clinics. In order to make this a scalable and cost-effective solution, Daniel has co-created an automated system; CognoSpeakTM. It is consistent and patients can do the test at home.

He has been working with professor Heidi Christensen over six years after his PhD. His research interests include medial applications of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) (e.g. people with dementia, stroke, and/or other mental disorders), automatic analysis of conversation, speaker diarisation, and tracking speech and language changes over time, detectiong TB through analysis of speech, automatic emotion/mood/anxiety detection from speech.

His general research interest is in the application of machine learning and signal processing in the field of Biology. Previously, he was involved in detecting and classifying TB and COVID-19 vocal audio such as cough, breath and speech in real-world environments as well as monitoring patients' long-term recovery using smart sensors such as an accelerometer in South Africa.  He also developed deep learning methods from third-generation sequencing (Oxford Nanopore) signals to study genomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics and epi-transcriptomics in the USA. Currently, he is analysing speech to detect the signs of early cognitive decline such as dementia in Sheffield, UK.
